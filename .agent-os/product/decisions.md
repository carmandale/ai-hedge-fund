Single LLM dependency creates vendor lock-in risks, availability issues, and limits user choice. Different LLMs excel at different tasks, and users may have preferences or cost constraints.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Single LLM Provider (OpenAI)**
   - Pros: Simpler implementation, consistent behavior, well-documented
   - Cons: Vendor lock-in, cost limitations, availability risks

2. **Dual Provider (OpenAI + Anthropic)**
   - Pros: Backup option, some choice, manageable complexity
   - Cons: Limited options, still dependency risk

3. **Multi-LLM Architecture (Selected)**
   - Pros: Maximum flexibility, no vendor lock-in, cost optimization, local model support
   - Cons: Increased complexity, potential behavior inconsistencies

### Rationale

Educational platforms benefit from maximum accessibility and flexibility. Supporting multiple LLM providers ensures users can choose based on their budget, privacy requirements, and performance preferences. Local model support via Ollama provides offline capabilities crucial for educational institutions.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- User choice and flexibility in AI model selection
- No single point of failure or vendor dependency
- Cost optimization opportunities
- Privacy-conscious users can use local models

**Negative:**
- Increased complexity in prompt engineering and testing
- Potential inconsistencies in agent behavior across models
- Higher maintenance burden for multiple integrations
